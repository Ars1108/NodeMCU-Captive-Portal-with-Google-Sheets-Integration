# NodeMCU-Captive-Portal-with-Google-Sheets-Integration
This project creates a captive portal using NodeMCU where users enter details like name, address, and contact number. These details are stored directly in a Google Sheet with date and time stamps. This setup is ideal for collecting user information in public WiFi scenarios such as cafes, hotels, or events.
