# NodeMCU-Captive-Portal-with-Google-Sheets-Integration
This project creates a captive portal using NodeMCU where users enter details like name, address, and contact number. These details are stored directly in a Google Sheet with date and time stamps. This setup is ideal for collecting user information in public WiFi scenarios such as cafes, hotels, or events.

Features
Captive Portal: When users connect to the WiFi network, they are redirected to a web page to enter their details.
Data Collection: Collects user details including name, address, and contact number.
Google Sheets Integration: Automatically stores the collected data in a Google Sheet for easy access and management.
Timestamping: Each entry is logged with the current date and time for accurate record-keeping.

Components Used
NodeMCU: A low-cost open-source IoT platform that is programmable using the Arduino IDE.
Google Sheets: For storing and managing the user data collected via the captive portal.
Google Apps Script: Used to create a web app that receives the data from the NodeMCU and logs it into the Google Sheet.

Benefits
Easy Deployment: Simple and cost-effective way to collect user information.
Real-time Data Logging: Automatically logs data with timestamps for better tracking.
Customizable: Easily modify the form fields and data handling as per your requirements.






This code sets up the NodeMCU as a WiFi access point (AP) and DNS server, which allows it to serve a captive portal. However, it doesn't provide internet access to the connected users. This is because the NodeMCU is acting as a standalone access point and not as a bridge to an existing WiFi network with internet access.

To provide internet access, you need to configure the NodeMCU to operate in both Access Point (AP) and Station (STA) mode simultaneously. Hereâ€™s how you can modify your code to allow the NodeMCU to connect to an existing WiFi network (providing internet access) while still serving the captive portal:
